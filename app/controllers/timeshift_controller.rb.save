class TimeshiftController < ApplicationController
# --Ruby Code Exercise--
# Without using any built in date or time functions, write a function/method that accepts two mandatory arguments (time and minutes) that can be added  toge$
# The first argument is a string of the  format "[H]H:MM {AM|PM}"
# And the second argument is an integer.
# Assume the integer is the number of minutes to add to the string.
# The return value of the function should be a string of the same format as the first argument.

#Required use cases:
# - The method should take into account going over from AM to PM or vice versa.
#- It will also handle going into the next hour.
# - AM/PM should handle upcase or downcase strings.
# - Error handling for mandatory arguments should be included.
# Example inputs with expected outputs:
# - ("9:13 PM", 10) should return "9:23 PM"
# - ("11:50 AM", 12) should return "12:02 PM"
